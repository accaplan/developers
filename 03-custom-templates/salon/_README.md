# README

1. Create a new Small Victory site using the Feed theme.
2. Copy the `_sv_custom.scss` (delete `_sv_custom.css`) and `sv_custom.js` (you can overwrite the existing one) into the site folder. (You don’t need to copy the example images, caption, or bookmark files – they’re just for example.)
3. Add the desired image sizes (`_xs`, `_sm`, `_md`, `_lg`, `_xl`, `_cover` ) to the filenames of your images. You can add captions and links to images as well (see example files).
4. You can adjust the sizing of images, customize styles, or add your own scripts in the `_sv_custom` JS and SCSS files.
