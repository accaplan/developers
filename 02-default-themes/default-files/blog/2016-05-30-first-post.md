## Basic concepts
A Small Victory site is represented by a folder. The files in this folder become the contents of your website. Updating your site happens automatically when Dropbox syncs (it syncs when it notices any changes). When you make changes, there might be a small delay as Dropbox syncs.

Small Victories includes some themes for common types of sites to get you started, or you can do something completely custom. You can customize these using the JavaScript and CSS files included in your site folder. Anything you can do with JavaScript or CSS you can do in Small Victories.
